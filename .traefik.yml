displayName: HTTP Authorization Policy Middleware
type: middleware
runtime: wasm
summary: >-
  Attribute-based authorization middleware that evaluates custom expressions
  against HTTP request properties (method, path, host, headers). Features a
  type-safe expression language with built-in testing framework. Ideal for
  enforcing team-based access policies from upstream ForwardAuth headers.

testData:
  expression: 'method == "GET" AND path startsWith "/api"'
  denyStatusCode: 403
  denyBody: "Access denied"
